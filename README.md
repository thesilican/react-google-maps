# its-not-react-google-maps

Because neither [`react-google-maps`][rgm] nor [`google-maps-react`][gmr] seem to work well for me.

# Install

```
$ npm install @thesilican/react-google-maps
```

# Documentation

I didn't really expect anyone else to use this library tbh. If you really want some documentation, please post an issue to the GitHub repository of this project, requesting documentation.
